### @blockshake/defly-connect

JavaScript SDK for integrating [Defly Wallet](https://defly.app) to web applications. For more detailed information, please check our [Defly Manual](https://docs.defly.app/app/overview/).

This is a fork of the Pera connect JavaScript SDK, for more details visit [Pera connect](https://github.com/perawallet/connect) on github.

### Quick Start

Let's start with installing `@blockshake/defly-connect`

```
npm install --save @blockshake-io/defly-connect
```

```jsx
// Connect handler
deflyWallet
  .connect()
  .then((newAccounts) => {
    // Setup the disconnect event listener
    deflyWallet.connector?.on("disconnect", handleDisconnectWalletClick);

    setAccountAddress(newAccounts[0]);
  })
  .reject((error) => {
    // You MUST handle the reject because once the user closes the modal, deflyWallet.connect() promise will be rejected.
    // For the async/await syntax you MUST use try/catch
    if (error?.data?.type !== "CONNECT_MODAL_CLOSED") {
      // log the necessary errors
    }
  });
```

If you don't want the user's account information to be lost by the dApp when the user closes the browser with userâ€™s wallet connected to the dApp, you need to handle the reconnect session status. You can do this in the following way.

```jsx
// On the every page refresh
deflyWallet.reconnectSession().then((accounts) => {
  // Setup the disconnect event listener
  deflyWallet.connector?.on("disconnect", handleDisconnectWalletClick);

  if (accounts.length) {
    setAccountAddress(accounts[0]);
  }
});
```

After that you can sign transaction with this way

```jsx
// Single Transaction
try {
  const signedTxn = await deflyWallet.signTransaction([singleTxnGroups]);
} catch (error) {
  console.log("Couldn't sign Opt-in txns", error);
}

// Group Transaction
try {
  const signedTxns = await deflyWallet.signTransaction([multipleTxnGroups]);
} catch (error) {
  console.log("Couldn't sign Opt-in txns", error);
}
```

### Customizing Style

You can override the z-index using the `.defly-wallet-connect-modal` class so that the modal does not conflict with another component on your application.

```scss
.defly-wallet-connect-modal {
  // The default value of z-index is 10. You can lower and raise it as much as you want.
  z-index: 11;
}
```

### Your app name on Defly Wallet

By default, the connect wallet drawer on Defly Wallet gets the app name from `document.title`.

In some cases, you may want to customize it. You can achieve this by adding a meta tag to your HTML between the `head` tag.

```html
<meta name="name" content="My dApp" />
```
